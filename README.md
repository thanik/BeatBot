[Game Features Video narrated by the producer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0KFxrB1waY)

BeatBot is a rhythm based platformer that has the player control a small robot who goes from world to world collecting resources to then swap to a different probe that will go and explore the next planet.

The player must navigate the level by jumping to the beat of the music track in the background. The player gains score through hitting jumps on time to the beat and also by collecting resources.

There is a specific amount of resources that the player must collect in order to progress to the next level. These are indicated by two different scores that are part of the UI system.  

This work is a part of the submission in DES502	Game Design and Development.

Executable binary with required assets can be found in [Release](../../releases) section.
